  <p>Deep in downtown Manhattan, where skyscrapers touch the heavens and crisp suits swagger around Wall Street, the city’s wealthiest have curbed their recycling habits.</p>
  <p>Five community districts across the city are recycling less of their waste than they were a decade ago, according to an analysis of the Department of Sanitation monthly collection <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Monthly-Tonnage-Data/ebb7-mvp5' target='_blank'>reports</a>. Among these districts are the wealthiest in the city, which the city’s targeted education campaigns have glossed over.</p>

  <p>Department of Sanitation officials, sociologists and enviornmental advocates are stumped as to why these five districts have reported decreases and offered no speculation. But Adriana Espinoza, New York City Program Director for the New York League of Conservation Voters, said it comes down to the fact that officials haven't placed enough resources into <a href='https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/our-work/zero-waste' target='_blank'>Zero Waste</a>, the city's initiative to contribute no waste to landfills by 2030.</p>

  <p>So far, most of DSNY's education campaigns have targeted specific communities, especially immigrant and poverty-stricken communities where cultural and language barriers anguished efforts for years. But in order to reach Zero Waste's goal, Espinoza said the city would have to put in money, time and resources akin to VisionZero, the city's popular intiative to prevent traffic accidents and fatalities that has boasted impressive numbers.</p>

  <p>"Our point that we try to make is that we don't think that that's enough," Espinoza said. "We'd like to see Zero Waste education on that same level."</p>
