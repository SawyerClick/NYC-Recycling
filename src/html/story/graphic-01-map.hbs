    <h2 class='chart-headline'>Poverty-stricken Districts Lead the Charge</h2>
    <p class='chart-description'>New York as a whole is recycling more, up from a diversion rate of 17% in 2009 to 19% in 2018. The jump is largely thanks to high-poverty community districts, where targeted community outreach played a role in boosting diversion rates.</p>

            <p>The city's current state of recycling has been years in the making, with notable increases starting around 2011, according to DSNY spokesperson Belinda Mager.</p>

        <div class='step' id='step2'>
            <p>The push was fueled by the poverty-stricken districts that recycled considerably more, particularly in the Bronx.</p>

            <p>The Department of Sanitation's concerted education efforts with neighborhood institutions in the last decade helped bridge cultural barriers, such as language, in these areas, according to Espinoza.</p>

        <div class='step' id='step3'>
            <p>But when it came to districts that are recycling less, the five culprits were spread across lower Manhattan, Staten Island and Brooklyn.</p>

        <div class='step' id='step-'>
            <p>The two chart-topping districts are among the high-wealth cluster in lower Manhattan and northwestern Brooklyn.</p>
            <p class='note'>**High income defined as a district having a median household income of greater than $90,000. The city's median is nearly $58,000, per the Census.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='step' id='step4'>
            <p>These Manhattan districts, CD 1 and CD 6, faced the starkest drops. Theyâ€™re also extremely wealthy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='step' id='step5'>
            <p>The greatest fall was in the elite Community District 1, which contains Wall Street, Tribeca and Battery Park City. The district's diversion rate fell six percentage points, from 53% in 2009 to 47% in 2018.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='step' id='step5'>
            <p>It's also tied for the wealthiest in the city with a median household income of $121,000, more than double the city's median of nearly $58,000.</p>
