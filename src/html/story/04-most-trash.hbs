    <h2 class='chart-headline'>Environmental Influencers</h2>
    <p>After New York City officials <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/us/new-york-city-declared-climate-emergency-trnd/index.html' target='_blank'>declared</a> a climate emergency in June, Nicole Grossberg decided to join the zero-waste education effort. Grossberg, a lifelong New Yorker who was a content strategist by trade, had been living a zero-waste lifestyle for years. Eventually, all of her work projects, which largely comprised social media management and advertising copywriting, started to revolve around going green.</p>
    <p>After a layoff in summer 2018, Grossberg, an Astoria resident, shifted to freelance work, where she had more control over the projects and messages. In her spare time, she dreamed of hosting her own workshops to help others go green.</p>
    <p>“I always kept putting it off and I feel like the universe was giving me all these signs along the way,’ Grossberg said. “So the summer of 2018, I had yet another layoff. It was like the second one in three years. And I kinda just took it as a sign from the universe that at that point was just screaming at me to follow my passion and do what I really wanted to do. So I decided to go off on my own.“</p>
    <p>She teamed up in August 2019 with Sandra Noonan, another zero-waste New Yorker, and began <a href='https://www.zerowastenyc.info/' target='_blank'>Zero Waste NYC Workshop Series</a>, a monthly lecture series aimed at educating audience members on how to reduce, reuse, recycle, and if all else fails, refuse. Right off the bat, the duo paired with DSNY’s nonprofit, The Foundation for New York’s Strongest, which involves teaming up for certain events. In <a href='https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zero-waste-nyc-workshop-series-fashion-beauty-tickets-86258857565' target='_blank'>February</a>, the Series is teaming with DSNY as a part of the city’s ReFashion Week program for a panel discussion on textile waste in the fashion industry.</p>
    <p>Admittedly, Grossberg said her audience is primarily those who have an interest in living a zero-waste lifestyle, which could only make a small dent in the city’s diversion numbers. Grossberg estimates there are typically about 45 attendees at each event, strong enough for DSNY to invite the Series into a formal partnership.</p>
    <p>“One of the tricks is to get the people who could really make a big difference,” Grossberg said. “I would love to have more of an audience that doesn’t know anything about zero waste. I just haven’t found the right way to reach everyone yet. It would be the people who don’t know much about it.”</p>
    <p>But to really tackle the bottom line, efforts need to reach the other 8.4 million New Yorkers who don’t have an inclination toward a more sustainable lifestyle. To inch toward all of them, Grossberg set up the workshops so all of the attendees leave as zero waste ambassadors - or influencers, as she calls them - to educate neighbors, friends and followers.</p>
    <p>“If we can't reach those people, then we want the people that come to our workshops to be influencers,” Grossberg said. “We want to encourage people to go out there and spread the message. We give them tools on how they can talk to other people without seeming like they're being preachy and aggressive about their beliefs.”</p>



    <h2 class='chart-headline'>Trash Mountain</h2>
    <p>Mediocre gains and educational pitfalls aside, New York suffers from a third thorn: it’s the trash capital of the world. A 2015 <a href='https://www.pnas.org/content/112/19/5985' target='_blank'>study</a> of energy and material flows in the world's largest cities found that the city that never sleeps produced 34 megatons of waste in 2011, which is roughly the weight of 1,380 Statue of Liberty landmarks. In context with other contestants, New York produced more than three times the waste of second-place Mexico City.</p>

    <p>But 2011 was the city’s worst year of the decade when it came to waste emissions. After that year, the city’s habits started to change due to the increased community education efforts, according to DSNY spokesperson Belinda Mager. The monthly tonnage reports show that waste production started to ease back down and consistently reached a low point every year. Meanwhile, recycling made steady gains.</p>

    <p>Gains weren’t made evenly throughout the city, however, and analysis shows that districts straggling along the bottom were most beneficial in picking up the slack. Each year pointed toward 2018 when the city saw, for the first time since 2011, a spike in waste emissions.</p>
    <p>In several districts, particularly those that have shrinking diversion rates, the amount of trash they're producing is constistently outpacing recycling.</p>
