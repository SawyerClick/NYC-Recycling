# NYC-Recycling
We're looking at the relationship between recycling in New York City's community districts and a neighborhood's key demographics: wealth, race and education level. This was created by Sawyer Click, Frida Cai and Aseem Shukla for the final project in Soma's Storytelling class at Columbia Journalism School.

### What have we found so far?
Over the last 10 years, recycling in the wealthiest community districts has dwindled. Less affluent districts have started recycling more.

### Current Status
We have a few visualizations that we made to help figure out our angle, but that's about it. We're trying to gather census data now to tie together how demographics play a role in a neighborhood's recycling habits.

### Where did the data come from?
Recycling data comes from NYC Open Data. We might now use all of them, but they're there in case we want to!

Census Data is going to come from Social Explorer, but we still need to get it.

### What do we want the final project to look like?
* A news app??? people can type in a neighborhood and it'll spit out some graphics related to it, mostly a fever chart of percent of waste recycled over the last 10 years.
* An d3-animated map of the city that highlights the changes in the percent of waste recycling from year over year.
* Scrolly-telling to zoom in on some neighborhoods and boroughs as a part of the narrative
* A moonshot but a 3d graphic where trashbags are piled up on each community district according to total waste
