# NYC-Recycling
Looking at recycling in New York City through the lens of wealth, race and public resources.

# Who made this?
This was created by Sawyer Click, Tongxu Cai and Aseem Shukla for the final project in Soma's Storytelling class at Columbia Jornalism School.

# Where did the data come from?
Recycling data comes from NYC Open Data and demographic data comes from the Census (but I still need to get that data)

# What do we want to find?
Is there a relationship between a neighborhood's demographics and it's propensity to recycle.
