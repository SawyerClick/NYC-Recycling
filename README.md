# ✨ For High Society, Less Recycling ✨
We're looking at the relationship between recycling in New York City's community districts and its wealth. This project was created by Sawyer Click, Frida Cai and Aseem Shukla for the final project in Soma's Storytelling class at Columbia Journalism School.

### What have we found so far?
Over the last 10 years, recycling in the wealthiest community districts has dwindled. Less affluent districts have started recycling more.![alt-text-2](https://github.com/SawyerClick/NYC-Recycling/blob/master/src/images/nyc-recycling.png "NYC's Community Districts")

### Current Status
We're in the final stages of creating our graphics and reporting.

### Where did the data come from?
Recycling data comes from NYC Open Data. We might now use all of them, but they're there in case we want to!

* <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Public-Recycling-Bins/sxx4-xhzg' target="_blank">Public Recycling Baskets</a>
* <a href='https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Recycling-Diversion-and-Capture-Rates/gaq9-z3hz' target="_blank">Recycling Diversion and Capture Rates</a>
 
We have census data by community district through the city's Community Profiles

### What do we want the final project to look like?
##### We Have:
* A scrollytelling map up top to get the point across that increases are coming from poverty-stricken districts
* A line chart to show by region who is performing best and worst
* A dot plot that shows the total recycling changes

##### To Add
* A Svelte app that lets users look up their own district and compare it with similar ones
* Make the line chart responsive in ai2html or use datawrapper for it
* Make the dot plot burst into a scatter plot to show the poverty rate/increase divide
